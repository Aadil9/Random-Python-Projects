# Random-Python-Projects
This repository is just little projects that I've created to help me automate computer tasks that might otherwise be laborious.

Alarm.py is a simple alarm.

Alt Caps Writing.py was initially satirically created to make fun of users on social media that write with alt caps in a mocking way.

File Mover.py can move any type of file from one folder to another folder. It also searches inside subfolders in the original folder for the required filetype. Additionally all other types of files in the folder can be deleted after use.

File Renamer.py can rename all files in a folder without having to do it manually. Good for if you want all the files to have the same name but a different number, for example. Incomplete but is still functional.
